 * Author: Bradley Beddoes
 * Creation Date: 11/10/2006
 * 
 * Purpose: Allows mock objects to capture and store objects which are created in private space inside the class being tested,
 * this in turn allows our testing framework to interrogate objects for correctness which it could otherwise never achieve. This implementation
 * allows for multiple objects to be captured and referenced.
