	 * here is that once the object is created, the calling code can use
	 * it as they would a stream and ignore the implementation details.
	 *
	 * The idea is that when the object goes out of scope it will be
	 * destroyed naturally, and in the destructor we can pass the result
	 * string to the logger to be logged.
